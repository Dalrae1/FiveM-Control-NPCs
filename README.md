# FiveM-Control-NPCs
Fun script I wrote to give the illusion of controlling NPCs

To use it, simply press ctrl.

This only gives the *illusion* of controlling NPCs. It actually just does some sweet buttery smooth camera tweening and ped replacing to accomplish it.

Pressing ctrl when aiming directly at a ped will switch to that ped.

Pressing ctrl when looking (But not aiming) at a ped will also switch to that ped.

Pressing ctrl when not aiming or looking in the general direction of a ped will switch to a random ped.

I disabled animal random ped changes, as there is an animals to peds ratio of like 1:10 in the GTA countryside, so you're basically guarunteed to switch to an animal.
